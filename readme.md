Cabueta is a DevSecOps Security Scan tool made for Github. It performs Static analysis, Dependency scanning,
Dynamic analysis, and Secrets scanning. It integrates with your project via
Github Actions.

Cabueta was created to improve Security at [VTEX](https://vtex.com/us-en/). It solves the issue of Insecure CI/CD pipelines, integrating security directly with CI/CD. It provides clear and actionable output via Markdown, and the JSON output for each tool.

- **Access resources in the AWS using OpenID Connect**. With Identity Federation it's possible to access resources in AWS from the Github Actions runner. One possible application is that for all repositories under an organization will send logs **securely** via POST to an AWS Lambda function, those POST requests will be authenticated by Github and AWS.
